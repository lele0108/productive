==========

HUGO is a chrome extension that acts as a practive focus campanion.

It uses Todoist to reward you time to use distracting websites (i.e. facebook, twitter) when you complete tasks. If you run out of this time, HUGO will block these websites for you and remind you of what you have to finish.

(coming soon)
HUGO will track productive websites (i.e. khanacademy, codeschool), and reward you a fraction (default 1/4) of the time you spend on these websites for distracting websites. 

HUGO's approach towards blocking website actively rewards the user, instead of becoming a "nuke all" extension. This approach is also better than hard schedules of when websites are allowed to be used beacuse HUGO tracks your active life and producitivy through the day to make adjustments to when you are allowed on distracting websites. 

In addition, HUGO's reward system encourages users to spend productive time, based on studies of reward psychology.
